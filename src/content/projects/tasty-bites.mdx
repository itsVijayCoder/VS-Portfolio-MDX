# Tasty Bites - Recipe Website

Welcome to [Tasty Bites](https://cookingnotes-frontend.onrender.com/), a
platform for food enthusiasts where you can discover and share delicious
recipes. Whether you're looking to try a new dish or save your favorite recipes,
Tasty Bites offers a user-friendly experience with everything you need to
explore the world of cooking. You can check out the live website
[Tasty Bites](https://cookingnotes-frontend.onrender.com/).

## Tech Stack

The tech stack used in this project includes:

- **React.js**: For building the user interface and handling state management.

- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive layouts.

- **Node.js**: For the backend server.

- **Express.js**: For handling HTTP requests and routing.

- **MongoDB**: For database management and storing recipes.

- **Render**: For deployment and hosting.

## Key Features

Here are some key features of the platform:

1. **Save and Organize Favorite Recipes**: Users can save recipes they love and
   access them easily at any time.
2. **Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions**: Every recipe includes detailed
   instructions to ensure a smooth cooking experience, whether you're a beginner
   or an experienced cook.
3. **Rating and Review System**: Rate your recipes and read reviews from other
   users to help you decide which recipe to try next.
4. **Add Your Own Recipe**: Users can create and share their own recipes,
   contributing to the growing community of food lovers.
5. **My Recipes**: A personal dashboard to manage the recipes you've created or
   saved.
6. **User Authentication and Authorization**: A login and registration system to
   personalize the user experience and secure the platform.
7. **Delete Recipes**: Remove any recipes you've added to keep your account
   organized and up-to-date.

## Future Improvements

Here are some planned updates for the application:

1. **Search Recipes by Ingredient and Cuisine**: Find recipes based on specific
   ingredients or cuisines. It allows you to narrow down the choices and try
   something new based on what you have available.
2. **Advanced Search Filters**: Introducing additional search filters, such as
   dietary preferences (vegan, gluten-free, etc.), time to prepare, and
   difficulty level.
3. **Recipe Sharing**: Allow users to share their recipes on social media or via
   links, making it easier to spread the word about your favorite recipes.
4. **Mobile App**: Creating a native mobile app for better accessibility on
   smartphones, providing notifications and offline access to saved recipes.
5. **Ingredient-Based Shopping List**: A feature that allows users to generate a
   shopping list based on the ingredients required for their chosen recipes.

## Challenges

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges:

1. **Real-time Updates**: Ensuring that changes to recipes and user data are
   reflected in real-time without affecting performance.
2. **Database Management**: Handling large amounts of recipe data efficiently
   while keeping the application responsive and user-friendly.
3. **User Experience**: Making sure that the website provides a seamless,
   intuitive experience, especially for users who may not be tech-savvy.
4. **Scalability**: Ensuring the backend can handle increased traffic as the
   platform grows, especially when users start uploading more recipes and
   reviews.

## In the Pipeline

Some future enhancements Iâ€™m planning include:

1. **Admin Panel**: A dedicated dashboard for admins to manage user-submitted
   recipes, comments, and reviews, ensuring content is appropriate and accurate.
2. **Recipe Video Integration**: Adding video tutorials for recipes, making it
   easier for users to follow along with step-by-step instructions.
3. **AI-Powered Recipe Suggestions**: Implementing an AI-based algorithm to
   recommend recipes based on users' preferences, past activity, and trending
   recipes.
