# NextJS Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio site, built with Next.js and deployed to Vercel.
The site leverages Next.js API routes to handle the backend, removing the need
for an extra server. This allows for efficient API integrations and also
supports database connections where needed.

## Tech Stack

When building a personal portfolio or content-driven website, the tech stack
usually boils down to two choices: either using a Content Management System
(CMS) or crafting a custom solution. For this project, I chose a custom approach
using MDX, which provides an enhanced version of Markdown for content creation.

The tech stack used in this project includes:

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and fast static site generation.
- **MDX**: For writing content with JSX support inside markdown files.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive layouts.
- **Shadcn** and **Aceternity UI**: For UI components and design consistency.
- **Motion**: For adding smooth animations and transitions.
- **Vercel**: For deployment, enabling fast and reliable hosting.

## Features

Here are some features you’ll find in this portfolio:

- **Smooth Animations**: Powered by Framer Motion for dynamic interactions.
- **Dark Theme Support**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **SEO Optimized**: Built with SEO in mind to improve visibility.
- **Static Page Generation**: Ensures fast page loads and better user
  experience.

## Challenges

One of the key challenges I faced was setting up MDX properly. I needed to
decide how to structure my content and manage the dynamic integration with my
Next.js app. Once that was sorted, everything else, including the frontend setup
with Tailwind CSS and Motion, was pretty straightforward.

## Future Updates

While there’s not much in the pipeline at the moment, some ideas I have for
future updates include:

- **Improved SEO**: To further optimize the site for search engines.
- **Contact/Hire Me Page**: Allow potential clients or employers to reach out
  easily.
- **User Authentication**: Adding a feature for users to sign in and save their
  preferences.
- **Payment Options**: If I decide to offer any paid services or consultations
  through the site.
