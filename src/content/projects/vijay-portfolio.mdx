# Vijay's Portfolio

Welcome to [**Vijay's Portfolio**,](https://vijay-dev-portfolio.vercel.app/) a
website designed to showcase my web development skills and personal projects.
This portfolio is fully built on the frontend using the latest technologies,
providing a smooth and interactive experience.

You can explore my other projects and get to know my approach to creating
user-centric designs and web applications. Check out my portfolio website

## Challenges:

  sections and ensuring that animations do not affect the usability or speed of
  the site.

  screen sizes, from large monitors to mobile phones, while maintaining its
  visual appeal.

- **Performance**: Balancing the use of animations with website performance to
  avoid lag or slow loading times, especially when showcasing large media or
  complex animations.
