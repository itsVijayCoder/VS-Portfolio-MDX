# Zentry Gaming Platform (Frontend)

Zentry Gaming Platform is a frontend-only clone of the original Zentry platform.
This project is designed to replicate the user interface and interactive
elements of the platform, including game listings, animations, and dynamic UI
effects. Built with **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **GSAP**, the platform is
focused entirely on creating an immersive gaming experience without any backend
or authentication systems.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – A React framework that provides a fast, server-side rendering
  solution for building the frontend.
- **TailwindCSS** – A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling and
  customization.
- **GSAP** – A JavaScript animation library that brings smooth and interactive
  animations to the platform.
- **Vercel** – A platform used to deploy and host the project for easy
  accessibility.

## Features

- **Game Listings**: Display dynamic, interactive game listings with filtering
  options based on game categories, ratings, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is built with a mobile-first design to
  ensure smooth and responsive experiences on all devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Interactive and smooth transitions, animations, and
  hover effects using **GSAP** for an engaging user experience.
- **Game Details**: Each game listing includes a detailed description, images,
  and trailers that are easy to navigate.

## Challenges Faced

- **UI Responsiveness**: Creating a fluid, responsive UI design that adapts well
  across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using **TailwindCSS** was initially a
  challenge, but Tailwind's utility-first approach helped speed up the process.
- **Animation Performance**: Integrating **GSAP** for smooth animations while
  ensuring the platform's performance remained optimal. We made sure animations
  were optimized and didn’t hinder page load times.
- **Data Handling**: Since the project is frontend-only, dynamically loading and
  displaying game data without any backend required some creative solutions
  using **static site generation** and **client-side data fetching**.

## In-Pipeline Features

- **Multiplayer Functionality**: Although not part of this project, the next
  steps include adding multiplayer features that would allow users to play games
  in real-time.
- **Leaderboard**: A feature to show player rankings and high scores across
  different games.
- **Progress Tracker**: A system to keep track of user progress within
  individual games.
