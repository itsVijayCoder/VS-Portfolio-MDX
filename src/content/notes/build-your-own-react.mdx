## **Build Your Own React**

One of the best ways to learn how something works is to build our own simplified
version of it.

In this exercise, you'll create a `render` function that takes React elements
and produces the equivalent DOM structure!

To keep things as simple as possible, we won't bother with the `createRoot` API
discussed in the previous lesson. Instead, we'll write a `render` function that
takes two parameters:

1. The React element, describing the UI we want.
2. A target DOM node that will house our application.

**This is meant to be a challenging exercise.** It's 100% OK if you can't solve
it. Spend 5-10 minutes on it, and then watch the video below.

**Acceptance criteria**?**:**

- The “Result” pane should show the UI described by the React element. It should
  contain an anchor tag, which links to Wikipedia, and contains the text “Read
  more on Wikipedia”.
- It should work with *any element type* (eg. anchors, paragraphs, buttons…)
- It should handle *all HTML attributes* (eg. `href`, `id`, `disabled`…)
- The element should contain the text specified
  under `children`. `children` will always be a string. **Interacting with the
  DOM(warning)** In order to solve this challenge, you'll need to know how to
  interact with the DOM, to do things like create DOM elements and append them
  to the page. We cover all of the methods you'll need in
  the [“Interacting with the DOM” reference lesson 👀](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/10-javascript-primer/01-dom-operations).

```jsx
function render(reactElement, containerDOMElement) {
  /* Your code here! */

  const domElement = document.createElement(reactElement.type);

  domElement.innerText = reactElement.children;
  for (const key in reactElement.props) {
    const value = reactElement.props[key];
    domElement.setAttribute(key, value);
  }

  containerDOMElement.appendChild(domElement);
}

const reactElement = {
  type: 'a',
  props: {
    type: 'button',
    href: 'https://wikipedia.org/'
  },
  children: 'Read more on Wikipedia'
};

const containerDOMElement = document.querySelector('#root');

render(reactElement, containerDOMElement);
```

```jsx
<html>
  <body>
    <div id='root'></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

<Accordion header="Solution Code" >
  ```jsx
function render(reactElement, containerDOMElement) {
  // 1. create a DOM element
  const domElement = document.createElement(reactElement.type);

// 2. update properties domElement.innerText = reactElement.children; for (const
key in reactElement.props) { const value = reactElement.props[key];
domElement.setAttribute(key, value); }

// 3. put it in the container containerDOMElement.appendChild(domElement); }

```

## Productive failure

So, you've just attempted the first exercise of the course! How did it go? I
suspect it was pretty tricky, unless you were already familiar with DOM
interaction methods. You may not have successfully completed it. You might be
feeling a bit discouraged or frustrated. **If so, I have some good news for
you:** you probably learned *a lot more than you think* from this exercise! Most
online courses give you everything you need right at the start. You can code
along with the instructor without breaking a sweat, and glide through the
exercise effortlessly. And, a month later, *you won't remember any of it.* It
turns out that **struggling and failing** is one of the most effective ways to
learn a new skill quickly! In academic circles, this is known as *productive
failure*. Here's a quote from
a [2019 scientific article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-019-0040-6):

> In Productive Failure, the conventional instruction process is reversed so
> that learners attempt to solve challenging problems ahead of receiving
> explicit instruction. While students often fail to produce satisfactory
> solutions (hence “Failure”), these attempts help learners encode key features
> and learn better from subsequent instruction (hence “Productive”). **In other
> words:** if you struggle with a problem, give up, *and then* watch the
> solution video, you're **much more likely to fully understand and remember
> things.** This is how we build lasting, generalized skills! Of course, it can
> be demoralizing to struggle. It can trigger our impostor syndrome, make us
> doubt ourselves. But this is the wrong interpretation! **All it means is that
> you're being challenged,** that you're attempting problems that are beyond
> your current reach. And that's the most effective way to learn! Struggling
> doesn't mean that you're incapable, *it means that you're growing!* When I
> worked at Khan Academy, we spoke a lot about having a “growth mindset”. A
> growth mindset is the belief that our brains are elastic, that we become
> smarter through practice, and that *failure is the fastest way to
> learn*. *This mindset is a superpower for developers.* Personally, it's had a
> huge impact in my own development, my own career. So, this course is designed
> to be challenging, especially for beginners. **It won't be *all* struggle** —
> I want us to have fun, after all! But occasionally, the exercises and projects
> will push you to go *beyond* what we've learned in the lessons. You can learn
> more about cultivating a growth mindset in this talk from Carol Dweck,
> presented at
> Google: [“Mindset: The New Psychology of Success”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-71zdXCMU6A).
