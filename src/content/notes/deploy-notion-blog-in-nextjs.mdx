# Deploy your Notion blog powered by Nextjs and Tailwind

## Getting started

Whenever I write a new blog, like this one, I use notion for drafting. Wouldnâ€™t
it be cool just to be able to switch the tag in notion to published and have it
live on your blog?

This will be a tutorial on how you can create your own blog powered by Notion,
Nextjs, and Tailwind.

## Notion setup

The first step would be to create an API key. You can follow the
[Notions Getting Started Guide](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started)
where we will be able to generate a new API key, which we will need for the
`env` file as `NOTION_SECRET`

For posting new blog articles, I already made a template, so we can simply
duplicate it and start writing articles. (Donâ€™t forget to connect your notion
page to your integration!)

Once we cloned the blog template, we need `DATABASE_ID` which can be taken from
the URL. It is the id after `xxx.notion.site/`

### Forking the codebase

[Click here](https://github.com/tuanphungcz/nextjs-notion-blog-starter/fork) to
fork the code base and pull the repository

```bash
npm install && npm run
```

The first time you run the blog, you will get an error of missing API key,
thatâ€™s because we haven't updated the `.env` file.

The last thing we need to do to make the blog work is to rename `.env.example`
to `env` and update the variables

```bash
# Notion secret integration
NOTION_SECRET=
# Database id from cloned template
BLOG_DATABASE_ID=

# Convertkit subscription (Optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_API_KEY=

# Umami analytics (Optional)
UMAMI_ID=
```

If we did everything right, we should be able to see the working blog ðŸŽ‰
