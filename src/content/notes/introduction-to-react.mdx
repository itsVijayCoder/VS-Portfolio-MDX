# Introduction to React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building
user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, React has become one of the most popular
frontend libraries in web development.

## Why Use React?

Here are some key benefits of React:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build encapsulated components that manage
  their own state
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient updates and rendering
- **Declarative Syntax**: Makes code more predictable and easier to debug
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Large community and many supporting libraries
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: Can be used for web, mobile (React Native),
  and more

## Basic React Concepts

### 1. Components

React applications are made of components. A component is a self-contained piece
of UI.

```jsx
// Simple functional component
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}
```

### 2. JSX

JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your
JavaScript.

```jsx
const element = <h1 className='title'>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

### 3. Props

Props (short for properties) are how components receive data from their parent
components.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// Usage
<Welcome name='Sarah' />;
```

### 4. State

State allows components to manage and track changes to their data.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Setting Up a React Project

The easiest way to start a new React project is using Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Your First React Component

Let's create a simple component that displays a list of items:

```jsx
function ItemList() {
  const items = ['React', 'JSX', 'Components', 'State'];

  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## React Ecosystem

React works well with many other libraries:

- **State Management**: Redux, MobX, Context API
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Styling**: CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
